# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds FlowForge's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). An ADR captures one
architecturally significant decision: the context that forced it, the decision itself, and its
consequences — so future contributors can understand *why* the system is the way it is, not just
*what* it is.

## Process

- Copy [template.md](template.md) to `NNNN-short-title.md` (next number in sequence, kebab-case title).
- Statuses: `Proposed` → `Accepted` (or `Rejected`); later `Deprecated` or `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- ADRs are immutable once accepted: to change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old
  one and update both statuses. Never rewrite history — the trail is the point (the same principle
  as our hash-chained audit log).
- Write an ADR whenever a decision is expensive to reverse, constrains future work, or would
  otherwise need re-explaining in every review.
